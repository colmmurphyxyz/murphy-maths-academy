        <p>
            I am a first year Computer Science student at University College Cork. I achieved over <em>two hundred and fifty eight</em> points in my Leaving Certificate 
            last year and now I want to give back and offer my expertise in the fields of mathematics and science to other students who are not quite as gifted as I am.

                Not only did Maths Extraordinaire, teach me calculus at an advanced level, he also taught me the value of friendship and acceptance. I was a very angry man before, and now I smile at rainbows. My life is changed. Thank you Colm Murphy.

                Colm Murphy taught me everything I know about physics. If not for Colm I never would have discovered my theory of special relativity.
                I owe everything to Colm and I can never repay him for his teachings.
